# Welcome

Hi there, I'm Byron. I'm a Senior Software Engineer based out of Denver, CO. I'm a big fan of synthesizers, cats, and the occasional code project when I have time. Lately I have been working on producing music and learning how to code audio plugins, more to come on both of those soon. 

I currently work remotely for [Xpress Technologies](https://xpresstechfreight.com/) based out of Chattanooga, TN building out their next generation ML product for connecting frieght with drivers. I'm very exited to share the rest of that 

To find out what I'm up to outside of work, check out my personal site at [bsamaripa.com](https://www.bsamaripa.com), thanks for stopping by!
