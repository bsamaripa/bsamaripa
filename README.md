# Welcome

Hi there, I'm Byron. I'm a Senior Software Engineer based out of Denver, CO. I'm a big fan of synthesizers, cats, photography, and the occasional code project when I have time. Lately I have been working on producing music and learning how to code audio plugins, more to come on both of those soon. 

To find out what I'm up to outside of work, check out my personal site at [bsamaripa.com](https://www.bsamaripa.com), thanks for stopping by!


# Languages 
 Below are the languages that I have worked in throughout my career though I have mostly focused on Scala, Typescript, and Python.
